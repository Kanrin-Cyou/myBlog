# Creation Pattern

## Singleton Pattern

## Factory Method Pattern

The Factory Method design intent is to define an interface for creating objects, but let the subclasses decide which class to instantiate.

```java
public abstract class KnifeStore {

    public Knife orderKnife(String knifeType){

        Knife knife = null;

        //now creating a knife is a mthod in the class
        knife = factory.createKnife(knifeType);

        // prepare the Knife
        knife.sharpen();
        knife.polish();
        knife.package();

        return knife;
    }

    abstract Knife createKnife(String knifeType);

}
```

```java
public BudgetKnifeStore extends KnifeStore {
    //up to any subclass of KnifeStore to define this method
    Knife createKnife(String knifeType){
        if (knifeType.equals("steak")){
            return new BudgetSteakKnife();
        } else if (knifeType.equals("chefs")){
            return new BudgetChefsKnife();
        }
        //.. more types
        else return null;
    }
}
```


## Factory Objects

### Benefits of Factory Objects
- Coding to an interface, not an implementation
- If there are multiple clients that want to instantiate the same set of classes, then by using a Factory object, you have cut out redundant code and made the software easier to modify.

### Example

Consider now there is a knife shop that creates knifes and sells them.

```java
Knife orderKnife(String knifeType) {
    
    Knife knife;
    // Concrete Instantiation - create Knife object
    if (knifeType.equals("steak")) {
        knife = new SteakKnife();
    } else if (knifeType.equals("chefs")){
        knife = new ChefsKnife();
    } else if (knifeType.equals("bread")){
        knife = new BreadKnife();
    } else if (knifeType.equals("paring")){
        knife = new ParingKnife();
    }

    // prepare the Knife
    knife.sharpen();
    knife.polish();
    knife.package();

    return knife;
}
```

Thus, whenever customers want to order new type of knife, then the shop will need to modify the orderKnife class. As business grows, they decides to open a knife factory.

```java
public class KnifeFactory-1 {
    public Knife createKnife(String knifeType){

        Knife knife = null;

        //create Knife object
        if (knifeType.equals("steak")) {
        knife = new SteakKnife();
        } else if (knifeType.equals("chefs")){
            knife = new ChefsKnife();
        }

        return knife;
    }
}

public class KnifeFactory-2 {
    public Knife createKnife(String knifeType){

        Knife knife = null;

        //create Knife object
        if (knifeType.equals("bread")){
            knife = new BreadKnife();
        } else if (knifeType.equals("paring")){
            knife = new ParingKnife();
    }

        return knife;
    }
}
```

Thus, we seperate the factory and shop. And the knife shops can order knifes from different factorys. Thus, you don't need to mofify the previous code, but just create a new factory.

```java
private KnifeFactory factory;

//require a KnifeFactory object to be passed to this constructor
public KnifeStore(KnifeFactory factory){
    this.factory = factory;
}

public Knife orderKnife(String knifeType){

    Knife knife = null;

    //use the create method in the factory
    knife = factory.createKnife(knifeType);

    // prepare the Knife
    knife.sharpen();
    knife.polish();
    knife.package();

    return knife;
}

```
