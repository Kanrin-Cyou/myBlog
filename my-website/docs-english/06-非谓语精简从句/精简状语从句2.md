# 精简状语从句（主语不一致）

export const Highlight = ({children, color}) => (
  <span
    style={{
      backgroundColor: color,
      borderRadius: '2px',
      color: '#fff',
      padding: '0.2rem',
    }}>
    {children}
  </span>
);

## 状语都是描述性信息 Doing/Done

### 构造两个简单句

### 主语一致
1. 选定其中一句话做状语
2. 省略作状语的句子主语
3. 被省略的主语后的动词变成 v+ing（如果是being可以省略）

### 主语不一致=&gt;主语不能省略
