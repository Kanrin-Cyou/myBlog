# 条件状语从句

## 1. If 条件句

- 真实条件句
- 虚拟条件句（虚拟语气）

首先判断是**真实**还是**虚拟**

虚拟的话 =&gt; 假设的是 **过去**，**现在**，**将来**？ =&gt; 想清楚后对应公式

## if 真实条件句 (主将从现)

|     |   If从句  |   主句  |
|---|---|---|
|   假设现在  |   现代的各种时态  |   一般将来时  | 
|   假设过去  |   过去的各种时态  |   过去将来时  | 
|   假设将来  |   一般现在时替将来  |   一般将来时  |  

- If you **work** with me, I **will** take us to the top.
- If she **is sleeping**, I **will** call her later.


- If tall chimneys **were built** above sea level, the tunnel **would be** well-ventilated.（假设能够成真）


- If it **rains** tomorrow, we **will** stay at home.


## if 虚拟条件句（虚拟语气）

如果我能去火星/如果我不缺钱

虚拟 =&gt; 变时态 =&gt; 时态往后退一格 （将来_现在_过去）

| 虚拟的时间 | IF从句的谓语形式（C） | 主句的谓语形式（Z） |
|---|---|---|
| 现在（x） | Cx: did 或 were | Zx: would(could,might) + do |
| 过去（g） | Cg: had done 或 had been | Zg: would(could,might) + have done |
| 将来（j） | Cj: were to do/should do | Zj: would(could,might) + do |

if往前推，主句四加一	

### 1.对现在的虚拟（if部分和现在事实相反）
**If did(were),** 主语**+would_could_might do.**

- `If I were you`, I would not accept his apology.
- `If I had enough money`, I might stop working and just go travelling.

### 2.对过去的虚拟（if部分和过去事实相反）

### 3.对将来的虚拟（不太可能发生的事情，主将从现是可能发生）
**If + did(were),** 主语**+would_could_might do. (**只掌握一种和现在虚拟一样的会用就好）
- `If I have time tomorrow`, I will help you. 可能发生
- `If I had time tomorrow`, I would help you. 不太可能发生，如果有时间就好了。
此外还有were to do/should do
