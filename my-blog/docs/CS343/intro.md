# Syllabus 

## Course Description 
An introduction to concurrent and parallel programming, with an emphasis on language constructs. 
Major topics include exceptions, coroutines, atomic operations, critical sections, mutual exclusion, semaphores, high-level concurrency, deadlock, interprocess communication, process structuring, shared memory and distributed architectures. 
Students will learn how to structure, implement, and debug concurrent programs.

[Note: Enrolment is restricted; see Note 1 above. Lab is not scheduled and students are expected to find time in open hours to complete their work. Offered: F,W]
Prereq: CS 350 or SE 350; Computer Science students only

## Core Concept

The following content based on : [Concurrency vs Parallelism](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1pgpn2gOSg)

### Parallel Execution
Making progress on more than one task at the exact same time.

### Concurrency
Making progress on more than one task - seemingly at the same time.

### Parallel Concurrent Execution
Making progress on more than one task - seemingly at the same time - on more than one CPU.

### Parallelism
Splitting a single task into subtasks which can be executed in parallel.
