## Course Source

My Plan for this course is to learn two corresponding courses provided by Coursera. The first one is called ["Object-Oriented Data Structures in C++"](https://www.coursera.org/learn/cs-fundamentals-1) which teaches the necessary syntax in object oriented programming(OOP). The Second one is ["Object-Oriented Design"](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/verify/LHE8QUFAJYMB) that exhibits the design methods used in OOP, which mainly focus on conceptual design including CRC card, UML and other concepts.
