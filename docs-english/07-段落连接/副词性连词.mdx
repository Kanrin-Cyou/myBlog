# 副词性连词 Conjuctive Adverbs

## 副词性连词，词性是个副词，有连词的含义，也就是说，形式上不具备连接词的功能

一般采用以下3种形式包装

### **1.**放在两个逗号之间做插入语

- Bob is good. Tom **,however,** is bad.

### **2.**放在句首，后面接逗号再接句子

- **Therefore,** the film is less than perfect.

### **3.**句子A ; 副词性连词 , 句子B

- The pianist was very ill**; therefore,** the concert was canceled.

### At the beginning (followed by a **comma**):
- **However,** the experiment was unsuccessful.

### After a **semicolon** (followed by a **comma**):
- We tried applying several different variables**; however,** the experiment was unsuccessful.

### In the middle (usually surrounded by **commas**):
- The experiment**, however,**was unsuccessful.

### At the end:
- The experiment was unsuccessful**, however**.

## 常见问题：混淆 从属连词 和 连接副词

连接副词后要立刻接一个逗号：
- **However,** the experiment was a failure.

但从属连词后并不会直接接逗号：
- ❌ **-Although, the experiment was a failure.-**
- Although the experiment was a failure, we decided to try again with new variables.
