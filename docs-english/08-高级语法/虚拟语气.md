## Introduction

作用： 非真实的 / 不太可能成真的

英语习惯用形式补充内容：把谓语动词的时态改变

## IF虚拟条件句

从句往前推（一个时态），主句四加一（would/could/should/might + ），（假设）将来同（假设）现在。

|     | 前推 |  if从句  |   主句  |
|---|---|---|---|
|   假设过去  | 过去->过去完成 | had done  |   would/could/should/might + <H1>have done</H1>  |
|   假设现在  | 现在->过去 | did<br/>were  |   would/could/should/might + <H1>do</H1>  |
|   假设将来  | 现在->过去 | did (were)<br/>were to do<br/>should do  | would/could/should/might + <H1>do</H1> |

### 假设过去

=> He was not a student, so he couldn’t attend the lecture.

If <H1>he had told</H1> her the answer, she <H1>could have understood</H1> it.<br/>
=> He didn’t tell her the answer. She didn’t understand it.

### 假设现在

=> I am not you, so I can’t make the decision.

### 假设将来

<H1>和if从句的区别在于对于未来的信心不同。</H1>

如果我明天有时间，我就会帮他。<br/>
可能有时间：If I <H1>have</H1> time tomorrow, I <H1>will</H1> help him.<br/>
不太可能有时间：If I <H1>had(were to/should have) time</H1> tomorrow, I <H1>would</H1> help him.<br/>

If I <H1>were to live</H1> my life over again, I <H1>would</H1> have you as my wife.<br/>

### 混合时态

<H1>主句是对现在的虚拟，从句是对过去的虚拟。</H1><br/>

### 简化的虚拟条件句

无if条件句(仅限 如果有/如果没有）<br/>

=If they had had better strategy, they would have won the battle.<br/>

=If we hadn’t had your help, we couldn’t have succeeded.<br/>

### 倒装虚拟句

当 if 引导的条件句省去 if 时，可将should，had，were置于句首，从而构成倒装虚拟句
