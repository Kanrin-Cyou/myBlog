## Introduction

作用： <Hb>非真实的 / 不太可能成真的</Hb>

英语习惯用形式补充内容：把谓语动词的时态改变

## IF虚拟条件句

从句往前推（一个时态），主句四加一（would/could/should/might + ），（假设）将来同（假设）现在。

|     | 前推 |  if从句  |   主句  |
|---|---|---|---|
|   假设过去  | 过去->过去完成 | had done  |   would/could/should/might + <Hb>have done</Hb>  |
|   假设现在  | 现在->过去 | did<br/>were  |   would/could/should/might + <Hb>do</Hb>  |
|   假设将来  | 现在->过去 | did (were)<br/>were to do<br/>should do  | would/could/should/might + <Hb>do</Hb> |

### 假设过去

| Example | Implication |
|--|--|
|If he <Hb>had been</Hb> a student, he <Hb>could have attended</Hb> the lecture.|He was not a student, so he couldn’t attend the lecture.|
|If <Hb>he had told</Hb> her the answer, she <Hb>could have understood</Hb> it.|He didn’t tell her the answer. She didn’t understand it.|


### 假设现在

| Example | Implication |
|--|--|
|If I <Hb>were</Hb> you, I <Hb>could make</Hb> the decision. |I am not you, so I can’t make the decision. |
|If I <Hb>were</Hb> a bird, I <Hb>could fly</Hb> to you right away.|I am not a bird, so I can’t fly to you right away.|
|If I <Hb>knew</Hb> his number, I <Hb>would ring</Hb> him up.|I don’t know his number, so I won’t ring him up.|

|If I <Hb>could</Hb> (can -> could)  arrangethe alphabet, I <Hb>would put</Hb> U and I together.||

### 假设将来

<Hb>和if从句的区别在于对于未来的信心不同。</Hb>

如果我明天有时间，我就会帮他。<br/>
可能有时间：If I <Hb>have</Hb> time tomorrow, I <Hb>will</Hb> help him.<br/>
不太可能有时间：If I <Hb>had(were to/should have) time</Hb> tomorrow, I <Hb>would</Hb> help him.<br/>

If I <Hb>were to live</Hb> my life over again, I <Hb>would</Hb> have you as my wife.<br/>

### 混合时态

<Hb>主句是对现在的虚拟，从句是对过去的虚拟。</Hb><br/>

如果你（过去）嫁给他，你（现在）就会是一个加油站服务员的妻子。<br/>
If you <Hb>had married</Hb> him, you <Hb>would</Hb> be the wife of a gas station attendant.<br/>

如果昨天早睡觉的话，你现在就不会头疼。<br/>
If you <Hb>had slept</Hb> early yesterday, you <Hb>would</Hb> not have a headache.<br/>

### 简化的虚拟条件句

无if条件句(仅限 如果有/如果没有）<br/>

=If they had had better strategy, they would have won the battle.<br/>

Without/But for your help, we couldn’t have succeeded.<br/>
=If we hadn’t had your help, we couldn’t have succeeded.<br/>

### 倒装虚拟句

当 if 引导的条件句省去 if 时，可将should，had，were置于句首，从而构成倒装虚拟句

=If I should win the lottery, I would buy a car. <br/>
如果我能赢得大奖，我就会买一辆车<br/>

=If he were to leave today, he would get there by Monday. <br/>
如果他今天出发，他就能在星期一之前到达那里。<br/>

=If he were to tell us everything, we could try to solve his problem. <br/>

=If you should change your mind, no one would“blame you. <br/>

=If he had not been promoted, he would never have remained with the company. <br/>
